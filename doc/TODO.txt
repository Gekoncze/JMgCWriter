### SOON ###
    add type formatter
        its result can be multi-line (for inline types) or single-line
        this should be handled correctly
        and also correctly handled by its users

    implement individual formatters + add tests
        EnumFormatter
        FunctionFormatter
        StructFormatter
        UnionFormatter
        VariableFormatter
        TypedefFormatter

    add test for classes
        Indentation
        Formatter
        Writer
        CEntityFormatters

### LATER ###
    add support for macro and macro call formatting
        might need to allow macros and macro calls to be CMainEntity
        or create special class for that, but that might be redundant
